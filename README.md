# LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System)

**Originally developed using React.js and a MySQL database running on a local server, I am currently reworking Limbic using Next.js and FireBase on Google Cloud Platform. **

## Project Overview

LIMbic is a laboratory information management system that allows a hypothetical analytical laboratory to manage their project database.
