# Limbic (Laboratory Information Management)

## Project Overview

**Originally developed using React.js and a MySQL database running on a local server, I am currently reworking Limbic using Next.js and FireBase on Google Cloud Platform. 
**

I developed Limbic to apply my knowledge of full-stack web development to a problem I was familiar with due to my previous career as an environmental consultant, that of organizing the project data of an analytical laboratory.

Limbic allows a laboratory business to track the details of their project and client databases. An analytical laboratory may be involved in the processing and analysis of soil, air, water, asbestos, lead, and other types of material samples. A given analytical project may involve over a hundred samples, and each sample must have an individual analytical result associated with it. This platform allows a laboratory business to track all of these project details, and associate these projects with a client within their database.
