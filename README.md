# LIMbic (Laboratory Information Management)

**Originally developed using React.js and a MySQL database running on a local server, I am currently reworking Limbic using Next.js and FireBase on Google Cloud Platform. **

## Project Overview

LIMbic is a laboratory information management system that allows a hypothetical analytical laboratory to manage their project database. This project combines my knowledge of full-stack web application development with experience from my previous career as an environmental consultant. 

LIMbic allows an analytical laboratory to manage critical information in their project pipeline. A laboratory may be involved in the analysis of soil, air, water, or bulk material samples. A given analytical project may involve over a hundred samples, and each may have several analytical results associated with it. This project information must be tracked in relation to a client and client's project. 

The challenge of capturing and presenting project information in a streamlined manner was one that I enjoyed working through during the development of this project. By applying my expereince in the environmental consulting field and receiving feedback from analysts at a commercial analytical laboratory, I was able to design the user-interface with the work flow of a sample receiver and analyst in mind. I believe the result is a useful and promising platform that could be developed further into a robust LIMS product.
