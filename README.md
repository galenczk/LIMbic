This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# LIMbic (Laboratory Information Management)

## Project Overview

I developed LIMbic to apply my knowledge of full-stack web development to a problem I was familiar with due to my previous career as an environmental consultant, that of organizing the project data of an analytical laboratory.

LIMbic allows a laboratory business to track the details of their project and client databases. An analytical laboratory may be involved in the processing and analysis of soil, air, water, asbestos, lead, and other types of material samples. A given analytical project may involve over a hundred samples, and each sample must have an individual analytical result associated with it. This platform allows a laboratory business to track all of these project details, and associate these projects with a client within their database.

    Programming Language: JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS
    
    Frameworks and Libraries: 
    - React.js
    - Express.js
    - MySQL
    - TailwindCSS
    - Axios
    - Formik
